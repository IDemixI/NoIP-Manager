## Random work-notes. Will be removed as I go.


# [X] Now it will ask for your noip.com account information (Username/email), password, Alias (If no alias selected, username will be used)
# [ ] For this to work we need to grab username out of noip homepage element xpath "visible-md-inline visible-lg-inline visible-sm-inline visible-xs-inline"


# [X] Don't worry you can manage this using noip-manager --configure"
# [X] If notifications were selected earlier, this is where they're now set up. Depending on your selection you will be asked for some details.
# [X] Thus ends the installer. The final step is for setup.sh to delete itself along with the entire folder.
# [X] a prompt will be displayed saying "use noip-manager --help for more information".


# [ ] IF NOTIFICATIONS AREN'T SET UP... WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO INSTALL THE PACKAGES VIA NOIP-MANAGER --CONFIGURE COMMAND

# noip-manager: If called without parameters, opens menu with some information on (see below this section)
# --renew: This is what will be scheduled to run via crontab
# --configure: Options such as: [1] Notification Configuration [2] Log Configuration (Level/Location) [3] Schedule Configuration (Next Run Date/Time)
# --help: list of all commands and what they do .. basically this section but tidy.
# --version: provides the current version of the script "Version x.x"
# --uninstall: Uninstalls the script completely (Ask user if they wish to also remove settings & log files)
# --repair: attempts to repair the script by checking github and downloading latest, writing over current files and setting up again
# --upgrade: checks github and downloads latest copy of script if it's newer. "Update available: Version X.X" "Current version matches latest (X.X). No update available."
# --logs: this will just open a view to the log file/s 

# 1. Add/Remove Noip Accounts
# 2. List all active hosts (See below)
# 3. Check last run status
# 4. Statistics - Total runs, total hosts updated, last host updated, next host to be updated.
# 5. Exit (or look at showing ctrl+c to exit?)

## ACTIVE HOSTS ##
# Hostname | Account Alias | Times renewed | Last renewal | Next renewal
# SUMMARY: Total Renewals | Last renewal | Next renewal

# When a new host is added I think it should do a run to grab username & hostnames & days until expiry.

# The --configure option needs to open a menu with options such as notifications, noip accounts setup, scheduled tasks.

##### STUFF WE FIND USEFUL - MAY USE THIS LATER! #####

# THIS SETS USER IN THE NOIP-RENEW-SKD SCRIPT... THIS WILL BE REMOVED AS WE WON'T DEAL WITH IT THIS WAY IN THE FUTURE.
# $SUDO sed -i 's/USER=/USER='$USER'/1' $INSTDIR/noip-renew-skd.sh - So we either need to add $USER to the .ini file, or our executable.

# Check to see if package is installed or not.
#if [ $(dpkg-query -W -f='${Status}' git 2>/dev/null | grep -c "ok installed") -eq 0 ];
#then
#  apt-get install git;
#fi

#$SUDO chown $USER $INSTDIR/noip-renew-skd.sh - Keep this line. Need to work on better system for setting next crontab automagically.
